I've been thinking about starting my own blog for the looongest time, but I "never" seemed to have time to do it. Yeah, I know, it's just a terrible excuse. But better late than never, right? And you can't believe how hard it was for me to even decide the name of the blog. It took forever, and another one while selecting the which tools and theme to use. Excuses, excuses, excuses. Note to self: just get started with it!

And finally here I am writing this first ever post on this blog with VS Code in WSL. Not that I have written many blog posts earlier anywhere else. Some, but not much. And hopefully this post won't be the last post :grin:.

What should you expect from this blog? Well it's hard to say exactly, but I'm suspecting it will mostly have something to do with Azure, DevOps, Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code or something along those lines. Last year I decided to dedicate year 2020 for studying more about Azure DevOps and Kubernetes. And that's something I have already started and will continue doing. But I know myself too well and I know that I will spend too much time on something totally different. And to be honest, I already have. Anyway, I'll try write something also from those trips to other rabbitholes. 

Only time will tell what will how this blog will evolve. I have loads of ideas, but I need to work with them for a while to get my head straight before starting to write. I might need to kick myself to not thinking too long and to just get started with writing. 

Then few words about myself. I've been working in IT for 20+ years, having a background in infra-side. I see myself as an IT Pro turning into more DevOps-minded guy. I love the idea of automating boring stuff. Powershell being the most familiar tool for that. There's lot to learn on that front also, for example how to use it more effectively.

My current job focuses around consulting, administering and architecting Azure solutions [@Cybercom](https://cybercom.com). Let's see what I can bring from daily work to this blog. Most propably something we are working with our customers.

I'll keep this first post short. One more time, welcome to building[4].cloud. Thanks for being here and hopefully you'll find something usefull from the upcoming future posts.
