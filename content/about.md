_"The knight who doesn't believe in Holy Grail, will never find it."_

I don't know who said that, but it is one of the principles I believe in. Through work, school and life. Sometimes we need to sacrifice something to gain new. Finding the balance is the key. If you do not believe that you can reach your targets or goals, maybe you need to adjust them. Otherwise, full speed ahead.
  
I have been working in IT for 20+ years, having a background in infra-side. It has been a constant learning curve to keep up with technology. It has been a long and wonderful road from the old NT4 on-premises times to running services securely in cloud. I believe that one of the best ways to get cloud infrastructure running as intended, is to use Infrastructure as Code approach. No more fragile snowflakes needing hours of nurturing.

I also have interest in security such as identity and access management, SIEM, privileged access management and such. There's a need to know and control who has access to which resources and when.

Another principle that I believe in is something Sir Richard Branson has said: _"If you fall flat on your face, at least youâ€™re moving forward"_.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Learn from your mistakes and move on.

While still turning myself from IT Pro being more DevOps-minded, I think it's time to start writing this blog. It's been in the making far too long already. Welcome to the ride with me. Let's see what this blog will turn into and where it takes us.
